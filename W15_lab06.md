The README.md is not in good shape, does not give a good description of what the program does. 
It also does not contain any directions on how to run or play the game.
It should be updated with instructions and pictures on how to build and run the program with ant.

The "ant -p" command only outputs the description for one task, "linenumbers", 
which creates a file containing all source files with line numbers. 
All build.xml targets should have description attributes to help users
use ant properly with this program.

The code compiles and runs successfully. However, the only game that is implemented is TicTacToe. 
The chat/message system works correctly, including the private message system.
Chess and gomoku are not yet implemented.
Currently, for TicTacToe, users can press "New Game" in the middle of a game to reset the game. This should be changed
to only allow users to start a new game after a game has finished.
There is also no "Draw" or "Tie" condition for TicTacToe, so nothing happens when the game results in a draw.
Also, the same user goes first every time a new TicTacToe game is started, so that should probably
be changed to allow users to take turns going first.

The "issues" involve fixing the README and the build.xml file are more along the lines of "Low Hanging Fruit", whereas implementing the other two games is a much more time consuming task.
The source code for the games has basically already been done in the previous version of the program, but now needs to be implemented using the new MVC setup.
